                                <h2>Brief Answers to Shareholder Questions</h2>
                                <p>First of all, we would like to explain the situation we had in this May. The sales of chips mainly happened before May, while the ramp-up speed of chip sales slowed down mainly because of the lack of flexible whole-device solutions (having features of easy transportation, widely available components, etc) from our customers (device producers). As dedicated projects on improving the design of BE200-based devices we believe we will see much better sales because the room for hash rate growth is still huge and our cost in terms of $/G is highly competitive.</p>

                                <p>The other point we would like to address is that we are not cooperating with any mining device producers other than in the forms of simple buyer-seller relationship. Nor we hold shares of any other device producers. Our pricing strategy was discussed in the board before, which targets low margin large quantity instead of high margin small quantity because: 1) If both device producers and miners can have real profit after risk premium we will develop reliable consumer of chips in the long time. 2) It alleviates the problem of many potential purchasers waste time waiting for future price adjustments. 3) Higher quantity of orders in this generation leads to much more support from the fab with respect to all future generations of chips.</p>

                                <p><strong>1) On the Balance Sheet, approximately how many chips does the current Inventory (Products + Materials + Masks) represent?</strong><br />
                                A little less than 60P of wafers, most of which are on their final stages of production. The materials consist mainly of lead frames for packaging. The mask is re-usable for years if there are continuing demands for the corresponding wafers.</p>

                                <p><strong>2) How many months of inventory do you estimate that represents?</strong><br />
                                Depending on the Bitcoin price. Under this price we expect it to be 1-1.5.</p>

                                <p><strong>3) On the Cash Flow there was significant expenses for gen3 production (~6mil USD). Does that represent the bulk of gen3 expenses, or are the expenses for gen3 going to continue (additional wafer batches ordered, etc.)?</strong><br />
                                It represent the order we already placed and paid for. There still are forecast plans for June we haven't paid for. They may be cancelled or delayed to later months according to how fast customers can turn Bitcoin chips to hashing power.</p>

                                <p><strong>4) When will dividends start, and how frequently will they occur?</strong><br />
                                When the cash-flow becomes positive. After we decide to put significant quantity of chips on ASICMiner owned farms it should be per week. Before that, per month.</p>

                                <p><strong>5) What is the status of gen 3.1 (shipping to customers, I think?)? How much does it help with energy usage -- do we have final chip performance numbers yet?</strong><br />
                                All shipped chips are gen 3.0 ones. What we had chosen for 3.1 helps with energy usage at 10% range and has some performance degrades. The final chip performance number is about 0.7W/G at 0.78V and 320MHz. Below that voltage we have less power draw and less speed.</p>

                                <p><strong>6) What is the progress on gen4?</strong><br />
                                It is 28nm and has two major improvements: the first one is to fix the design errors we had with 40nm (which made our silicon data two times worse than simulated data). We believe that 0.35W/G at rated speed of 400MHz would be achievable in 40nm if no mistakes were made before. The second one is the technology improvement from 40nm to 28nm in terms of density, speed and power.</p>

                                <p>We are on the stage of evaluating the final design choices by running the physical design flow on different settings.</p>

                                <p><strong>7) What is the status of self mining? What is the rollout schedule for the data centers?<br />
                                    8 ) What is the status of franchising partners? When can we expect to see income from them?</strong><br />
                                We will report the more detailed status to the board first. The short answer is that deploying and financing is easy while getting cheap electricity and proper device solution takes time. When we have farms running we can update the related information with real time hash rate.</p>

                                <p><strong>9) Can you please clarify this sentence from 21st April : "The dividend schedule will be aggressive, as AM will not require large sums of retained capital." &lt; is this still actual, or meanwhile something changed?</strong><br />
                                It is still actual. The condition in May is not a part of the plan. When we were forecasted permissively about this summer's production power of the fab, we ordered as many wafers as we could to prevent the bottleneck with wafer production.</p>

                                <p><strong>10) What is the average selling price of AM gen3 chips (price per Gh/s)?</strong><br />
                                About 0.5$/G for sold chips.</p>

                                <p><strong>11) What is that ~4M CNY in financial report/expenses at exchange?</strong><br />
                                Exchanged to USD.</p>

                                <p><strong>12) What is the cash flow ratio between the amount of Chips Fabricated and the percentage of the batch that is dedicated to cost.</strong><br />
                                There are no orders dedicated to cost in the short time. So it's 1:0.</p>

                                <p><strong>13) What is the Break Even Point of this batch of Chips?</strong><br />
                                Although the cost of making could be estimated by companies with experience on fabricating chips of high-end technology nodes, we
                                would rather retain the accurate price per chip from the public.</p>

                                <p><strong>14) What is the estimated conversion time from chip sales to dividends?</strong><br />
                                The conversion time itself is fast and should not be the main stagnation of the time frame.</p>

                                <p><strong>15) Will the funds from future Gen 3 chips be used to fund Gen 4 chips or distributed as a dividend, and what relative percentage of income will be retained for Gen 4?</strong><br />
                                Both. 1/3 as forecasted.</p>

                                <p><strong>16) Previously our Asicminer farm was mining bitcoins and distributing a weekly dividend, will Asicminer update its present hash rate in the mining farms to account for current difficulty changes and to procure a secondary supply of Bitcoins to adapt for rapid changes in Bitcoin prices?</strong><br />
                                Yes. But that should be when we replace the farm with BE200 based devices, otherwise it is no point considering the 0.12-0.15$/kwh electricity price we get for our old farms.</p>

                                <p><strong>17) What ever happened to the dedicated PR person and should AM make a website for distributors and for Chip inquiries?<br />
                                18) Can we please get weekly, bi-weekly or monthly updates about progress, plans, sales etc. for preventing FUD in this thread?<br />
                                19) Can you please communicate more clearly/frequently with shareholders?</strong><br />
                            When we are sure we get a good solution for the lack of communication we will announce.</p>

                            <p><strong>20) What are the future plans and visions of Asicminer?</strong><br />
                            There will be at least two generations ahead. If future Bitcoin market cap allows there can be more. As we are keeping the chip design capability to grow with state-of-the-art technology as well as good channels with fabrication we can be flexible in terms of business mode be it chip-based or device-based.</p>

                                <p>There are no general updates this time, only the replies to the questions raised and submitted by forum shareholders:</p>
                                <h2>Specific Updates</h2>
                                <p>Submitted Questions:
                                1) When can we expect the financial report that's supposed to coincide with the next round of dividends?
                                re 1) May 27.</p>
                                <p>2) With the switch to selling chips, can we expect dividends to be paid out on are "more monthly" basis?
                                re 2) Most likely yes.</p>
                                <p>3) What capacity of gen 3 hardware is supposed to be used for franchised mining?
                                re 3) Depending on the capacity of our franchisees. We personally think 20P could be possible even inside China.</p>
                                <p>4) What are the current approximate terms of franchised mining, i.e. what does it take to become a franchisee and how are AM and the shareholders profiting from it?
                                re 4) We have the deployment team to investigate and audit the franchisees. We prefer the original 80/20 division and the 80% are calculated as our mining income. But the cost of the device (without chips) needs to be calculated in so there will be adjustments.</p>
                                <p>5) Are there any current plans of improving the PR; maybe bi-weekly short summaries or a PR person (board member?)? Are question sets like this an option, maybe once a month?
                                re 5) This question set can be posed more frequently. For the PR topic, it's still a to-be-solved problem.</p>
                                <p>6) Is it feasible to create a "gen 3.5" with the consumption drawbacks fixed? With the consumption issue at hand, what is the timeframe for gen 4; are there any adjustments?
                                re 6) No "gen3.5", but there will be "gen3.1", which is exploiting the production options from the fab the minimize the consumption.</p>
                                <p>7) After recent crackdowns on BTC exchanges in China, is AM still unaffected and are there strategies to continue operations in case of problems?
                                re 7) There are no crackdown on BTC exchanges. What the central bank did was to secretly prevent banks from keeping their company bank accounts without placing any public bans. It reflects the fact that the gov has still been pretending that they are neutral to Bitcoin.</p>

                                <p>This is to inform that friedcat met with the board today and provided some updates. </p>
                                <h2>General Update</h2>
                                <p>Tapeout and initial testing of the Gen-3 chip was a success. The power draw is higher than expected - it remains to be seen by how much it can be reduced. Current developments focus on optimizing Gen-3 and working on Gen-4 which will be a lower nm tech. Gen-4 is overall a more challenging product, but friedcat and his team are confident that AM can compete both on price and power-efficiency with each generation of chips. AM will provide an open-source reference design for the PBC board for Gen-3 when sales are offered on a more casual basis. The packaging of the chip may change over time (point of optimization), so the board design needs to accommodate this.</p>
                                <p>The exact pricing is negotiated with large quantity buyers at the discretion of AM within the range advertised. The production rate will be high enough to sustain the empirically observed exponential growth of the hashing power within the near future. AM is trying to trade off risk with rewards as much as possible when allocating chips to self-mining, franchising and sales.</p>
                                <p>The dividend schedule will be aggressive, as AM will not require large sums of retained capital. The rationale is that AM doesn't need to invest large sums into infrastructure and that the majority of chip production costs will be covered by the business partners on a contract schedule. The new round of dividends are scheduled to begin as soon as the first large purchases have concluded and should precede or coincide with the publication of the updated financial statements.</p>

                                <p>Submitted Questions:
                                1) What is the status, size, and expected delivery of the next batch of chips? What about the one after that? 
                                re 1) This month: 850k, next month: 3.35m (order size), June: 6.7m (order size), assuming each chip is 10G.</p>
                                <p>2) What are the final specifications of the generation 3 chips? Initial tests of ROCKMINER showed an increased power consumption (http://blog.rockminer.com/#!/2014/04/13/Testing_Results_Of_BE200.md). What is the actual power consumption? 
                                re 2) Worse than expected due to power distribution surprises. Actual power consumption 0.5w-0.7w within reasonable speed range (7G-11G)</p>
                                <p>3) When will the ordering terms for generation 3 chips be published? Has the pricing been adjusted in any way meanwhile? What about auctions like we had with generation 1 hardware?
                                re 3) Most orders come from sample chip requests first, then collaboration with our tech team for about 1 month. So till now the ordering are one-on-one. The price hasn't been adjusted yet. The auction works only after there are widely available proven reference designs for immediate mass production.</p>
                                <p>4) When are the new chips expected to start mining in ASICMiner datacenters and what hashrate are you currently planning on deploying?
                                re 4) May-June for air cooling and June-July for immersion cooling. They are only capable of 3PH. Most should go franchising or as chips for other vendors' OEM products.</p>
                                <p>5) When are the sales revenues of the chips expected to be paid out to shareholders?
                                re 5) When the balance payments are received and exchanged for Bitcoins.</p>
                                <p>6) What conditions/prices does ROCKMINER (as a big shareholder of ASICMiner) get for generation 3 chips?
                                re 6) Same as other large scale purchasers.</p>
                                <p>7) Is there an ongoing cooperation with Allied Control in terms of Datacenter development? How does ASICMiner/shareholders profit from it?
                                re 7) Their container project seems going well. Also there are third party designers planning to make boards solely for immersion cooling. So we don't have to spend much design efforts on it.</p>
                                <p>8 ) What current plans for generation 4(+) are there?
                                re 8 ) Gen4 is 28nm and our main focus is fixing the unexpected problems of this generation. The room of improvement is still large and the positive news is that even we have a lot of problems in this gen of chip we remain in the most power- and cost-effective class.</p>
